    I'm Zoltán Csóré from Budapest, Hungary, software architect. I work in this industry since 2006, constantly learning
    new technologies and skills. I have already experienced a lot with PHP, Symfony, Unity3D as a game developer and as a VR developer,
    frontend with Angular and vanilla js, and a little as java developer. I'm constantly learning DevOps as my needs dictate it, I'm experienced with Maven, Aritfactory, and Azure workflows. I also worked as a Xamarin mobile developer, but now I'm mainly focused on dotnet core and Azure projects.

I participated also in a startup called Nexter as CTO. Here I designed and built a complex system of surveillance cameras in pubs and bars of Budapest that could be used for deciding where to go next when partying around the city, using a handy mobile app. The company isn't active now, but I've gained a lot of experience about streaming, video processing, Raspberry Pis and microservice development.

In my free time I'm a musician, singer, guitarist and lyricist, in a band called [SZ4P](https://sz4p.hu). In fact, the homepage of my band is generated by my BandPageGenerator project that generates static html page from a music band's social presence. [You can find the project here.](https://github.com/codernr/band-page-generator)

I'm really interested in how I can bring my hobby and my work closer so I have plenty of plans yet related to music. That's why the name of this blog.
